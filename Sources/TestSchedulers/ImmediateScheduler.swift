/// You can only use this scheduler for immediate actions. If you attempt to schedule actions
/// after a specific date, this scheduler ignores the date and performs them immediately.
///
/// This scheduler is useful for writing tests against `Observable`s that use asynchronous operators,
/// such as `subscribe` and others, because it forces the `Observable` to emit
/// immediately rather than needing to wait for thread hops or delays using `XCTestExpectation`.
///
/// - Note: This scheduler can _not_ be used to test `Observable`s with more complex timing logic,
///   like those that use `Debounce`, `Throttle` etc, and in fact
///   `ImmediateScheduler` will not schedule this work in a defined way.
